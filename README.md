# SpaceShooter

A simple space-shooter written in VisualBasic as part of a college project.

The objective is to reach the highest possible level before dying, with each progressive level spawning more enemies, asteroids and gravity wells.

Killed enemies have a chance of dropping health and power-ups.

- Green Hexagons restore health
- Red Hexagons increase damage
- Blue Hexagons give you a shield
